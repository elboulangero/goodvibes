Credits
=======

Goodvibes is a solo project: it's mostly me writing code and bugs. But there's
more to it than just code. This page is an attempt to give due credits.

Let me try to list here all the people who help with Goodvibes, who contribute
a bit of their time and skills to the project.

Technologies
------------

It's amazing the amount of technology involved in developing such a simple
application as Goodvibes. Let's give some due credit here as well.

First, there are a bunch of web services for everyday operation:

 * `GitLab <https://gitlab.com>`_ provides everything needed for development:
   code hosting, issue tracker and even continuous integration.
 * `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_ builds and hosts this
   documentation, and the service is free.
 * `Weblate <https://weblate.org>`_ is a great platform for translation, and
   the service is free for FOSS projects. Many thanks to its author Michal
   Čihař.

Then, the software itself stands on top of a lot of free and open-source code,
written by thousands of people. Goodvibes simply couldn't exist without such an
ecosystem. It's impossible to credit everyone here, so let's just list the main
libraries that Goodvibes depend on, and keep in mind that this is just the tip
of the iceberg.

 * `FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_
 * `GLib <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib>`_
 * `GStreamer <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org>`_
 * `GTK <https://www.gtk.org>`_
 * `LibSoup <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/libsoup>`_

Finally, there's many other media players for Linux, and this is where all the
inspiration comes from. And to this day I still rely on their code to write and
improve Goodvibes codebase.

 * `Parole <http://docs.xfce.org/apps/parole/introduction>`_
 * `Quodlibet <https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io>`_
 * `RadioTray <http://radiotray.sourceforge.net>`_
 * `Rhythmbox <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Rhythmbox>`_
 * `Totem <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Totem>`_

Talking about inspiration, the last word goes to *mgo* and *jcdr*, two fellow
engineers who taught me a lot during my early years in the business. I hope you
guys are doing great!
