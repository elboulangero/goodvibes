**Goodvibes** is an internet radio player for GNU/Linux OS. It aims to be
light, simple, and to get its job done without any fuss.

Features
--------

The main interface is quite stripped-down, but there's a couple of additional
features waiting for those who dare to open the *Preferences* window !

 * multimedia keys support (ie. the `<play/pause/>`, `<previous>` and `<next>`
   keys that are present on most keyboards).
 * display notifications (ie. information that pops up when the song change).
 * do not suspend (ie. prevent the system from suspending while a radio is
   playing).
 * autoplay (ie. start playing the last radio when you start the application).
 * MPRIS2 support (ie. integration with modern desktops).

And for those of you who live mainly in a terminal and avoid graphical user
interfaces, you should know that you can build Goodvibes without GUI, and
control it via the command-line client provided.

Under the hood
--------------
