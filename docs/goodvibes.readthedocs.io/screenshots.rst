Modern Desktops
---------------

Nowadays, desktop environments usually provide a media player applet,
integrated somewhere in the desktop user interface. This applet provides basic
control over media players that implement the `MPRIS2
<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/>`_ specification.

These screenshots show both Goodvibes and the media player applet from
different desktop environments.

Old-style Desktops
------------------

It's possible to launch Goodvibes with the ``--status-icon`` option. In this
mode, Goodvibes will not display a main window, but will instead add an icon
to your notification area (also called system tray).

This is a kind of legacy feature, and it will be removed from Goodvibes at some
point in the future. This is not supported by the toolkit (GTK) anymore, and
this is also disappearing from various desktop environments (GNOME and Ubuntu
at least).

Anyway, here's how Goodvibes looks like in *Status Icon* mode.
