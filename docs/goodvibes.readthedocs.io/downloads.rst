The easiest way to install Goodvibes is to use the package provided by your
Linux distribution, or to install via Flatpak. Alternatively, you can also
build the application from source.

Alternatively, you can also use the packages that are available from my
`unofficial Debian repository <http://pkg.arnaudr.io>`_ for "buster" and
"sid". That will give you the latest version of Goodvibes.
